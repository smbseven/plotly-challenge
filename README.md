Plot.ly Homework - Belly Button Biodiversity

Build an interactive dashboard to explore the Belly Button Biodiversity dataset, which catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels.
The dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, in the study) were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare.

Step 1: Plotly


Used the D3 library to read te data and created a drop-down menu that affects the rest of the elements in the web-page:
1. A horizontal bar plot
2. A Bubble chart that shows the samples
3. Metadata of the selected subject
4. **Bonus** A Gauge chart that shows weekly washing per individual
